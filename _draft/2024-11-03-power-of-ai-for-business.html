<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    As the world becomes increasingly digital, businesses of all sizes are looking 
    for ways to become more efficient, competitive, and data-driven. One technology 
    that's transforming the way businesses operate is artificial intelligence (AI). 
    While it may sound like something only tech companies use, AI is accessible to 
    anyone and can deliver impressive results for non-technical business owners. 
    Let’s break down what AI is, how it can help you automate tasks, and some simple 
    steps to start learning about it.

<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
<p>
    Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a field of computer science that enables machines 
    to mimic human-like abilities such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. 
    Unlike traditional software that follows explicit instructions, AI-powered systems 
    analyze data to recognize patterns and make decisions without constant human input. 
    It’s the technology behind things like personalized product recommendations, 
    smart assistants like Siri and Alexa, and even self-driving cars. However, 
    you don’t need to be a tech expert to start leveraging AI in your business.
